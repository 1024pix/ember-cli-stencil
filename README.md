> Automatic discovery of [Stencil.js][stencil] components for your Ember application

Stencil provides a great, opinionated process for defining Web Components
(custom elements) using TypeScript and JSX. The problem is that Ember has to be
told about what these custom elements are and what events they can emit for you
to integrate the two libraries together.

Because of the conventions of Stencil and the Ember CLI respectively, we can wrap
up all of that boilerplate so that your custom elements "just work".
